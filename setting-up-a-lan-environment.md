2. Right click ZeroTier One from your taskbar, click **Join Network**, and use network id `6ab565387a62aeb4` to join with allow managed checked.
3. Let me know once you have joined, I will authorize your node ID.
4. Open a run window using `Windows + R`, type `ncpa.cpl` and press enter.
5. Right click ZeroTier One, click Properties, double click Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) (the name, not checkbox), click Advanced, uncheck Automatic metric, enter `1` for Interface metric. *You need to do this everytime ZeroTier One is launched, unfortunately.*
